* Experimented with SQL queries to extract tables of death cases and total cases around the world. Developed a formula for timeframe and death rate percentage that could simplify the visualization by 70%.

* Generated SQL visualization queries that can be used further in Tableau dashboard creation.

* Developed a creative Tableau dashboard that displays all Covid impact worldwide from January 2020 to April 2022. Globally, I considered the infection period. Developed visualization with a world map displaying total deaths and cases in a yearly manner.

* My Tableau Public link is here. You can use this link to get the real Dashboard of this project with the all CSVs which I used in visualization of the Dashboard.(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tirth7406)
