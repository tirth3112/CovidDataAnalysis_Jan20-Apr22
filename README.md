* generated SQL visualization queries that can be used further in Tableau dashboard creation.


* Design creative Tableau Dashboard with all Covid impact all over the world from January 2020 to April 2022. I considered the Infection timeframe all over the world. developed visualization with a world map with total deaths and cases in a yearly manner.
